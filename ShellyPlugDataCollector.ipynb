    "# Collecting Data from an old Heating System\n",
    "## First Steps\n",
    "Due to the climate and energy crisis, something had to be done to reduce our fuel consumption. We have a 27 year old gas heating system with a simple control system. One of our first actions was to turn the heating off when we were away for several days and turn it back on in time for our return. We bought a switchable plug (Shelly Plug) and a WLAN-enabled temperature sensor (Shelly H&T). This enabled us to keep an eye on the temperature in the house via the corresponding APP and to activate the heating if necessary on cold winter days.\n",
    "This gave us an easy way to save energy without sacrificing comfort.\n",
    "\n",

    "As  shown in the left diagram in the beginning the temperature is constantly decreasing until it reaches a lower limit of about 10°C. After the 24th it rises within about 5 days due to a heat up in preparationof our return. The diagramm at right shows to current consumption of the heating system for control and water pumps. It was activated twice in the middle of the month to prevent the temperature to fall below ~10°C and a constant operation during heatup. The hight of the power graph indicates the amout of heating.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Discovery\n",
    "By checking the indoor temperature from a distance, we noticed that the heating did not always behave as expected. Therefore, we analyzed the electricity consumption of the heating in more detail over longer time periods and were surprised how well we could understand what the heating was doing. We discovered situations where the heating was running very inefficiently.\n",
    "Therefore, we first had to systematically collect data so that, in a further step, we could preferentially activate the heating when it can run very efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Python Code for Data Logging with a Raspberry Pi\n",
    "The data is collected via an HTTP request over the home WLAN. Since this is done 24 hours a day/7 days a week, an old Rasperry Pi was used, which permanently documents the power flow via the Shelly Plug in a csv file.    \n",
    "With this notebook the code can be tested easily. A pure Python code is then exported for the Raspberry."

    "## Hardware\n",
    "Except for the plug, an old Raspberry Pi Model B is used. It requires only a few watts of supply power. Since it is a full Linux machine, it can run Python programs. Remote operation is possible via SSH. Therefore, the RasPi can be positioned anywhere within the range of the WLAN and does not need a screen or keyboard. A USB power supply with 2A maximum current is used for stable continuous operation. Unlike with the previous 1A power supply, it has been running stably for several weeks now. \n",

    "The following diagram is a preview of a more detailed analysis as shown in the next notebook. The picture shows the electrical power curve of the gas heater.  The heater is turned on at about 7:00 and turned off at 21.00. The peaks to over 400W are caused by the glow igniter to start the gas burner. It can be seen that the gas burner is turned on and off cyclically during the day. The power consumption for the pumps, valves, etc. is well below 100W. Immediately after start and twice after 18:00 you can see a small pause in the cycle as well as a phase that requires about 50W of power. These are phases when the hot water boiler is heated up. The slowly lengthening cycle during the day is also noticeable. This results from the rising outdoor temperature and thus reduced heating power. A more detailed analysis will follow.\n",
